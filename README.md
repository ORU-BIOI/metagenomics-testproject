## Metagenomics workflow ##
A workflow for metagenomics analysis

###Install
Running [INSTALL.sh](https://github.com/ORU-NGBI/metagenomics-workflow/blob/master/INSTALL.sh) should create two virtual python environments, sci2 and sci3 which are python2 and python3 environments respectively. Snakemake requires python3.

###Snakemake
To use snakemake one needs to add the sci3 environment to the PATH. The simplest way to do that is to source the file [source_to_add_snakemake.sh](https://github.com/ORU-NGBI/metagenomics-workflow/blob/master/source_to_add_snakemake.sh)
