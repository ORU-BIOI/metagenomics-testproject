###Install###
Running [INSTALL.sh](https://bitbucket.org/orebro-ngbi/microbiome-workflow/raw/master/INSTALL.sh) should create two virtual python environments, sci2 and sci3 which are python2 and python3 environments respectively. Snakemake requires python3.

###Snakemake###
To use snakemake one needs to add the sci3 environment to the PATH. The simplest way to do that is to source the file [source_to_add_snakemake.sh](https://bitbucket.org/orebro-ngbi/microbiome-workflow/raw/master/source_to_add_miniconda.sh)
